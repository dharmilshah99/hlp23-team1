(* 
    HLP23: This module will normally be used exclusively by team member doing the "smart channel route" 
    part of the individual coding. During group phase work how it is used is up to the
    group. Functions from other members MUST be documented by "HLP23: AUTHOR" XML 
    comment as in SmartHelpers.

    Normally it will update multiple wires in the BusWire model so could use the SmartHelper function for
    this purpose.

// TODO:
// Dont move wires which have two segments in the channel?

/// Automatically moves all wires which intersect the channel
/// 1. Detects all wires in the model which pass through the channel
/// 2. Sorts them in the ideal order so that wires are separated in the channel, if possible
/// 3. Moves wires so that they are equidistant to one another in the channel
