(* HLP23

    This module will normally be used exclusively by team member doing the "smart autoroute on single
    wire creation" part of the individual coding. During group phase work how it is used is up to the
    group. Functions from other members MUST be documented by "HLP23: AUTHOR" XML 
    comment as in SmartHelpers.

    It does not need specific "get started" test code since is called whenever a new wire is created 
    or (not usual) a symbol is moved so far that the topology of a wire chnages and it is autorouted 
    again from scratch.

(* HLP23 AUTHOR: Jian Fu Eng (jfe20)
NOTE:   For ease of understanding, algorithm, variable names and documentation of code below are all explained 
        in the simple case of no rotated symbols (ie wire.InitialOrientation = Horizontal).

        However, the code implemented supports the rotated case as well.

Implemented the following Smart Routing Algorithm:

    1)  Check if initial autorouted wire has any intersections with symbols. 
        If yes, calculate the bounding boxes of all the intersected symbols.
    2)  Attempt to shift the vertical seg of the 7 seg wire to buffer amount left of the left most
        bound of the intersected symbols. 
        If there are still intersections, try shifting to the right most bound + buffer.
    3)  If there are still intersections, recursively try to shift the horizontal seg of the 7 seg 
        or 9 seg wire to either the top or bottom most bound of the intersected symbols. 
        If both shifted wires still result in an intersection, compute the vertical distances between 
        the start/end pos of the wire and the top/bottom bound of the intersected symbols. 
        Using the 4 vertical distances computed, decide whether to try shifting the wire up or down 
        depending on which results in a wire with shorter vertical distance.
        
        A max recursion depth is defined for step 3 so that Issie will not break when there are physically 
        no possible routes that will not intersect any symbol (eg when dragging a symbol around such that 
        the dragged symbol is within another symbol) or when there are special corner cases that have not 
        been implemented yet (eg symbol A is in top left quadrant with input port facing up, connected to
        symbol B in bottom right quadrant with output port facing down, with other symbols in between the
        2 symbols).
